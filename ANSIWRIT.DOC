Ansi Writer Version 0.1 - by Giorgos Saridakis
----------------------------------------------

First of all , I must ask all Greek people to forgive me for writting this
in English , but I do it for commercial reasons , i.e. somebody from Europe
may download this program ;-) .
But let me introduce Ansi Music Writer 0.1 . It took me several hours to 
write , so I'd appreciate it if you registered . What happens if you dont ?
I'll explain that in a little while .

Why did I write this
--------------------
Because I thought it was a good idea , and ANSI Music is *fun* .
I think more Sysops should take the time and make some sounds for
their BBS's . But , users as well may find it enjoyable to send sounds
to their fellow users through their modems . Anyway , I thought it 
was a nice idea . I think there is another program (dunno what it's called)
that does about the same job , but , hey , this is Greek :-) Support me !
Besides , the registration fee is so small anyone can afford it.
(see below for more info..)

Moving Around
-------------
..is very easy , I dare say . You can press <h> at any time inside the 
program and get online help . I think everything's obvious . Still , if
you get stuck somewhere , and *if* you're a registered user , then you
can contact the author (that's me) and ask for help . Nice , huh ?

Hints & Tips
------------
I tried to correct every possible bug , but there is still a very very small
chance I've missed something . If you DO find a bug in the program , contact
me , tell me exactly what you did and how you did it , what the error message
was , the address it appeared and you'll get an update for free :-)
You can stop the playback option by striking and key . Also , striking any
key will get you out of the help screen.

What is Shareware
-----------------
It's a concept that says that you can try something and pay for it if you
like it . That means you're not allowed to use Ansi Writer for ever without
registering it , but even if you do , haha , you're still missing major
functions of the program :-) Let me explain :

1. Your consience will bother you forever . I stayed awake at night to 
   write Ansi Writer and Ansi Player . Just think of me spending my
   nights in front of my monitor instead of something nicer ;-)
2. Your name will not appear anywhere in the program , instead it will 
   prompt for you to register it all the time , which will result to
   twisting your nerves any , maybe , someday, you'll end up God knows where.
3. The input buffer is *too* small :-) You cannot have more than 50 entries
   of notes , commands etc . After that you'll be prompted to S)ave or E)mpty
   the record buffer . Not a pleasant idea . 
4. You cannot append to files . You can only create new files and you're 
   unable to , let's say , continue a song where you left it last time
   you were messing around with Ansi Writer .
5. You cannot view the music piece you're editting . You will be blind , 
   lost forever , not knowing what you're really writting . Awful !
6. Most important of all , you cannot load melody files into the playback 
   buffer , which means , you have to exit to DOS and execute ANSIPLAY <file>
   to play the melody you've previously recorded . 

What do I get if I Register ?
-----------------------------
1. A clear consience ! You'll sleep better at nights , wake up nicer in the
   mornings , enjoy your meals better , people will treat you more kindly ,
   you'll finally get to go on a date with that girl/boy you've been trying
   to get out with all these months, your financial/social/emotional/physical
   status will improve by at least 100% . Just think about it ;-)
2. Your lovely name will appear everywhere , this program will be your pal !
   You can tell your secrets to it , it won't tell anyone ! You'll finally
   get rid of those annoying messages prompting you to register and register
   and register . You'll feel so nice you'll regret you didn't send me more
   money... :-)
3. You'll get a laaaaaaaarge record buffer . Now , you can input as many
   notes and commands as you want , without beeing left alone in the cold
   anymore . How nice it will be...
4. You'll get to append to files , imagine the possibilities . You can 
   continue where you left of last time with no trouble at all.
5. You will be able to view what you were writting . Very useful , take
   my honest word for it :-)
6. You get to load recorded files from disk and play them . Great !
7. You'll be the first to get the new version of the program , at half the
   price the other will get it , which will include many many new functions , 
   such as viewing and editting the piece by entering notes on the pentagram 
   , mouse support , pull down menus . Plus : You get online help by me ...
7. You'll get more music files if you want ! :-) Awesome !


.....and what do I ask for ALL that ? Just 2500 dr. Just that . Now , dont
tell me that's a lot of money . For 2500 I'll send you a ANSIWRIT.REG proper
file (which , by the way should be in the same directory as ANSIWRIT.EXE) .
I'll send it to you by modem (your call) , by mail (your mailing expenses) , 
and by any other way you wish , as long as you pay for it . It's your choice!
I think I'm not asking for much. Please consider registering this program .
I need the money :-) . Ah , by the way , I almost forgot . If you intend to
use this program for commercial reasons , i.e. make money using it then the
registration fee goes sky high :-) It becomes 5000 dr!! Still a great bargain!
